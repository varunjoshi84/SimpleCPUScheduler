# SimpleCPUScheduler

Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator
Description: Develop a simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round
Robin, Priority Scheduling) with real-time visualizations. The simulator should allow
users to input processes with arrival times, burst times, and priorities and visualize Gantt
charts and performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time.
